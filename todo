The flow of the program
1) capture screen for analyse 
2) Use ML models to find the location of the fish bobber
3）Move the mouse to the bobber
4) Listen for audio spike to determine when the fish was caught
5) Simulate a click for the catch
6) recycle the process

Module 1
1)  pyautogui to save the screenshot 
2)  feed screenshot to ML to get the location of the bobber

Module 2 
1)  TensorFlow to train the model
2)  capture the location of the bobber
3)  If the screenshot is saved instead of just passed delete the image

Module 3
1)  move the cursor to bobber location by using pyautogui
2)  Once fish is caught(determined by the pyaudio) click
3)  Recast the fishing bobber

Module 4
1） Use pyaudio to listen for the output of pc for a spike of volume
2)  Default listen for 20 seconds
